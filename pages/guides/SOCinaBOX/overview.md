## Rationale
While tailored SIEM implementations are immensely beneficial to an enterprise (and we continue to strive towards that), however there may be instances where an enterprise is
* <b>New to SIEM</b> and would like to know how to quickly extract value from data
* <b>New to Azure Sentinel</b> and would like to learn how to navigate within the product and assess its features

The intention of SOC in a Box is to provide guidance around what configurations can be made within Azure Sentinel, reducing the time to deploy and ensuring a structured outcome. The content packages outline which Connectors, Analytics Rules and Workbooks should be enabled - depending on the data sources an enterprise has, one or more content packages can be deployed. 

In the content packages, only a subset of all the native Connectors / Analytics Rules / Workbooks are enabled, these are the typically essential ones (based on a generic enterprise profile) - the remainder can always be enabled if deemed relevant.

For content packages on more advanced use cases, refer to the `Advanced Content` section in the navigation bar on the left.
