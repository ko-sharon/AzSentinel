## Overview
This repository aims to provide information about security analytics in general, and also in the context of operationalizing it in Azure Sentinel.

Applying the basic principles of product management to a security analytics program can help to structure and ensure that the implementation will achieve the intended outcomes. It is important to:

* First identify the <b>Rationale (why?)</b>
* This will then determine the necessary <b>Requirements (what?)</b> 
* Which in turn dictate the appropriate <b>Configurations (how?)</b>

An additional dimension of consideration is the <b>data processing lifecycle</b>, simplified here into three main stages: <b>Capture, Process, Consume</b>.
